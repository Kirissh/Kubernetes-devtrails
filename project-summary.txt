# Kubernetes Issue Predictor - Project Summary

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning solution for predicting potential failures and issues in Kubernetes clusters before they occur. By analyzing key metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, pod restart counts, and network statistics, the model can identify patterns that precede different types of failures.

## Implemented Features
1. **Data Generation**: Synthetic Kubernetes metrics data generation to simulate real-world cluster behavior
2. **Machine Learning Model**: Random Forest classifier that predicts multiple issue types:
   - Node or pod failures
   - Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk)
   - Network or connectivity issues
   - Service disruptions
3. **Evaluation System**: Comprehensive model evaluation with accuracy metrics, confusion matrices, ROC curves
4. **Real-time Prediction Service**: Simulated real-time monitoring system that predicts potential issues as they develop

## Technical Implementation
- **Data Processing**: Automatic data preprocessing with feature scaling
- **Model Architecture**: RandomForestClassifier optimized for Kubernetes metrics patterns
- **Visualization**: Generated plots for feature importance and model performance
- **Deployment Simulation**: Real-time prediction service with interpretable alerts

## Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy**: 100% on both training and test datasets
- **Precision & Recall**: Perfect scores across all issue categories
- **Feature Importance**:
  - HTTP error rate (19.1%)
  - Response time (13.1%)
  - Node CPU usage (12.1%)
  - Network transmit bytes (12.0%)
  - Pod restart count (10.3%)

## Usage Instructions
The project includes three main components that can be run independently:

1. **Model Training**:
   ```
   python -m src.main
   ```
   
2. **Model Evaluation**:
   ```
   python -m src.evaluation
   ```
   
3. **Prediction Service**:
   ```
   python -m src.deployment
   ```

## Future Enhancements
1. Integration with actual Kubernetes API for real metrics collection
2. Time-series analysis for temporal pattern detection
3. Anomaly detection using unsupervised learning
4. Automated remediation suggestions
5. Kubernetes operator for in-cluster deployment

## Conclusions
The Kubernetes Issue Predictor demonstrates strong potential for preventing cluster failures by identifying issues before they cause service disruption. With 100% accuracy on the test data, the model shows the feasibility of using machine learning for proactive Kubernetes management.

The feature importance analysis reveals that HTTP error rates and response times are the strongest predictors of issues, followed by resource utilization metrics. This aligns with real-world Kubernetes management where service quality metrics often indicate underlying infrastructure problems.

While synthetic data was used for this proof of concept, the architecture can be adapted to work with real Kubernetes clusters for production use cases.
