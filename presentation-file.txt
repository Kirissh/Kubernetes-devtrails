# Kubernetes Issue Predictor - Hackathon Presentation

## Slide 1: Introduction
- Project: **Kubernetes Issue Predictor**
- Goal: Predict Kubernetes cluster issues before they happen
- Technologies: Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Our approach: Machine learning to identify patterns preceding failures

## Slide 2: Problem Statement
- Kubernetes clusters experience unexpected issues:
  - Pod crashes and failures
  - Resource bottlenecks (CPU, memory, disk)
  - Network connectivity issues
  - Service disruptions
- These issues lead to downtime and service degradation
- Traditional monitoring is reactive, not predictive

## Slide 3: Our Solution 
- AI/ML model to predict failures before they occur
- Analyze critical metrics to identify patterns
- Four issue types predicted:
  - Pod failures
  - Resource exhaustion
  - Network issues
  - Service disruptions
- Actionable alerts with remediation suggestions

## Slide 4: Technical Implementation
- **Data Collection**: Simulated Kubernetes metrics
- **Feature Engineering**: 10 key metrics processed and normalized
- **Model Selection**: Random Forest Classifier (optimized parameters)
- **Evaluation**: Comprehensive metrics, visualizations, ROC analysis
- **Deployment**: Real-time prediction service with alert generation

## Slide 5: Data and Features
- Key metrics captured:
  - Node CPU/Memory/Disk usage
  - Pod restart count
  - Pod resource utilization
  - Network I/O metrics
  - HTTP error rate
  - Service response time
- Time-based pattern recognition

## Slide 6: Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: 100% on test data
- **Precision & Recall**: Perfect scores across classes
- **Feature Importance**:
  - HTTP error rate (19.1%)
  - Response time (13.1%)
  - Node CPU usage (12.1%)
  - Network metrics (12.0%)
- **Visualizations**: Confusion matrix, ROC curves

## Slide 7: Live Demo
- Training the model
- Evaluating performance
- Real-time prediction service in action
- Alert generation and remediation suggestions
